# QuickNotes

QuickNotes is a basic note-taking application developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The app is built using Java and Firebase, providing users with secure authentication, real-time data synchronization, and CRUD operations for managing their notes.

## Features

1. **User Authentication using Firebase:**
   - Secure registration and login using email and password.
   - Managed by Firebase Authentication for reliable access and session management.

2. **Storing Notes in Firebase Firestore:**
   - Real-time data synchronization and offline support.
   - Notes include fields such as title, content, and timestamp for detailed management.

3. **CRUD Operations on Notes:**
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete notes effortlessly.
   - Efficient data retrieval and manipulation with Firestoreâ€™s robust querying capabilities.

4. **Synchronization of Notes Across Devices:**
   - Changes made on one device are instantly reflected on other devices.
   - Real-time data synchronization ensures the latest version of notes is always available.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
